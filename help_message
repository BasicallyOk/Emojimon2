# Commands
Check out my repo at https://github.com/BasicallyOk/Emojimon2
Commands will always start with **!em**.

> To get started, you can use !emnew\_trainer to initiate as one of my ~~guinea pigs~~ contestants.

> If you need to make sure that I am still alive, first off, I really appreciate your care, and !emping should do the trick. 

Beware though, you don't want to bring down the wrath of the world's biggest 
slave trader.

## Battling

So I see that you're already thirsty for blood

Begin a battle by challenging someone with **!embattle\_challenge @\<whoever that is\>**

> ### Basics
> 
> - Just react and you're good buddy
> - Don't lose ~~cuz I will have your soul~~
> - There's no quitting once you have started a battle
> - If you are being challenged, losing will still give you ~~shame~~ xp (halved), winning will quadruple it, so take it

## Guess the Emoji

> The bot will randomly take a server emoji and use it. You have to react with the corresponding emoji to win it.

## Catching Emojis

> Well you just need the quickest finger in the West
> - If you caught it, emojimon will slip into your DM ~~and ask you to a local orgy~~
> - If you already got 4 in your team, you have to say bye to one, or simply lose it.
> - If you dont want to change your mon, just skip it

## Checking on your Emojis

> You can use **!emcheck_team** to check the stats of your team using a sick spider chart
> You can also check their current abilities with **!emcheck_move**
> If you want to teach an emoji an ability, use **!emlearn_move**, abilities will be unlocked as your emojis battle and level up or evolve

Type **!emstat_help** if you need to know what the gibberish u see in your stats are
